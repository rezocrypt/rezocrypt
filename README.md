**`Systems Engineer | Everything is a System`**

I have been inspired by software and hardware design from an early age. However, I never accepted it as a profession; instead, I chose to remain free. Later, I became fascinated by the idea of "analogy," and after exploring a large number of them, I realized that everything is a system (hardware and software design are just beautiful examples of this).

Additionally, the idea of open source inspired me, and I decided to contribute because, as the saying goes, “Individually, we are one drop. Together, we are an ocean.”

I am also very interested in how decentralized networks work and how anonymity can emerge within darknets. I have spent a lot of time understanding how these networks function, including I2P, Tor, and similar systems.

Feel free to ask me any questions from the topics mentioned below in interests.
